A typical decision neuroscience task is similar to the dot task discussed in the literature review. That is a discrete perceptual task requiring the subject to discriminate between one of two choices. This type of task can be broadly described as a "two-alternative forced choice" (TAFC) task.

The crux of this thesis was to fit driving to this paradigm; how can the complex task of driving be reduced in complexity to allow for effective modelling of the

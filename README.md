# Thesis
Repository contains the MATLAB code I wrote for my Biomedical Engineering Thesis:
"Can Decision Neuroscience Help Make Our Roads Safer"
This involved the creation of a task capable of simulating all of the 
essential characteristics of a driving decision scenario within a known
decision neuroscience framework that could be used to analyse results.

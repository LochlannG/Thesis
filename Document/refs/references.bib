Despite the ubiquity of SAT, the question of how neural decision circuits implement SAT has received little attention up until a year ago. We review recent studies that show SAT is modulated in association and pre-motor areas rather than in sensory or primary motor areas. Furthermore, the studies suggest that emphasis on response speed increases the baseline firing rate of cortical integrator neurons. We also review current theories on how and where in the brain the SAT is controlled, and we end by proposing research directions that could distinguish between these theories.},

  abstract = {We compared the ability of psychophysical observers and single cortical neurons to discriminate weak motion signals in a stochastic visual display. All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated.},

This study explores electroencephalography (EEG) and facial expressions as physiological monitoring tools to build models that detect two cognitive states, namely, engagement and instantaneous attention, and three cognitive skills, namely, focused attention, planning, and shifting. First, while wearing a 14-channel EEG Headset and being videotaped, data has been collected from 127 subjects taking two scientifically validated cognitive assessments. Second, labeling was performed based on the scores obtained from the used tools. Third, different shallow and deep models were experimented in the two modalities of EEG and facial expressions. Finally, the best performing models for the analyzed states are determined. According to the used performance measure, which is the f-beta score with beta = 2, the best obtained results for engagement, instantaneous attention, and focused attention are EEG-based models with 0.86, 0.82, and 0.63 scores, respectively. As for planning and shifting, the best performing models are facial expressions-based models with 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. The obtained results show that EEG and facial expressions contain important and different cues and features about the analyzed cognitive states, and hence, can be used to automatically and non-intrusively detect them.},

  abstract = {In recent years, time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained much popularity in the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, MVPA may appear daunting to those who have been applying traditional analyses using event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs). To ease this transition, we recently developed the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling (ADAM) toolbox in MATLAB. ADAM is an entry-level toolbox that allows a direct comparison of ERP/ERF results to MVPA results using any dataset in standard EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format. The toolbox performs and visualizes multiple-comparison corrected group decoding and forward encoding results in a variety of ways, such as classifier performance across time, temporal generalization (time-by-time) matrices of classifier performance, channel tuning functions (CTFs) and topographical maps of (forward-transformed) classifier weights. All analyses can be performed directly on raw data or can be preceded by a time-frequency decomposition of the data in which case the analyses are performed separately on different frequency bands. The figures ADAM produces are publication-ready. In the current manuscript, we provide a cookbook in which we apply a decoding analysis to a publicly available MEG/EEG dataset involving the perception of famous, non-famous and scrambled faces. The manuscript covers the steps involved in single subject analysis and shows how to perform and visualize a subsequent group-level statistical analysis. The processing pipeline covers computation and visualization of group ERPs, ERP difference waves, as well as MVPA decoding results. It ends with a comparison of the differences and similarities between EEG and MEG decoding results. The manuscript has a level of description that allows application of these analyses to any dataset in EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format.},

  abstract = {Cyclists are vulnerable road users who are more likely than others to be involved and injured in accidents and crashes. To enhance cyclists' safety, governments around the world have introduced bicycle passing distance laws, yet research into the effectiveness of these laws is still limited. This study examines the changes in driver behaviour (passing distance, aggressive behaviour) and negative attitudes towards cyclists, as well as cyclist numbers on the roads following the introduction of a cyclist minimum passing distance law in Western Australia in 2017. The study employs a quasi-experimental design using self-reported survey data on driver behaviour and attitudes from two independent samples collected before (N 2016 = 302) and after (N 2020 = 426) the introduction of the law. Average daily cyclist numbers per month were retrieved from Western Australia's Mainroads Government Agency for 35 cycle counters on shared paths (803 data entries prior to the law and 737 data entries post its's introduction) and one cycle counter on a road in the CBD of the state capital (data entries for 349 days pre-law and 657 days post-law). Results showed that the introduction of the law was followed by an increase in self-reported passing distances by car drivers. However, the results also indicated that aggressive behaviour and negative attitudes towards cyclists had increased between 2016 and 2020, while cycling numbers remained stable. Taken together, the results indicate that the cyclist minimum passing distance law effectively addresses its targeted outcome, while it appears less effective and potentially counterproductive in addressing attitudes, related behaviours and cycling numbers in the short term. The findings have implications for policy makers looking to introduce cyclist minimum passing distance laws. Specifically, such laws may need to be rigorously enforced and to be accompanied with other interventions targeted at changing attitudes and norms concerning cyclists.},

  abstract = {Cycling for transportation has multiple benefits to both individuals and societies. However, in many countries, cycling rates are very low. One major deterrent is hostile or aggressive behaviours directed towards cyclists. Past research has established that negative attitudes towards cyclist are a major driver of aggressive behaviour. However, the attitudinal roots that motivate these negative attitudes are currently not well understood. This study investigates to what extent negative attitudes towards cyclists are rooted in a sense of attachment to cars, and environmental attitudes. Furthermore, the study examines whether the distinctiveness of group-membership of cyclists, as signalled by cycling attire, influences the link between attitudes and aggressive behaviours directed at cyclists. An online survey of 308 car drivers measured automobility and environmental attitudes, attitudes towards cyclist, and aggressive behaviour addressed at two groups of cyclists (lycra-clad or casually dressed cyclists). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that automobility attitudes, but not environmental attitudes, were associated with negative car driver attitudes towards cyclists. A significant link between negative attitudes towards cyclists and aggressive behaviour addressed at cyclists was not moderated by the type of cyclist shown. These findings provide a more refined understanding of the basis in which negative attitudes towards cyclists are rooted and how they affect driver behaviour. This research may inform campaigns and initiatives aimed at changing attitudes towards cyclists.},

Although many of these tests were designed for testing typical observers, recent studies have begun to utilize general-purpose tests for studying specific, atypical populations (e.g., super-recognizers and individuals with prosopagnosia). In this study, we examined the capacity of four tests requiring binary face-matching decisions to study individual differences between healthy observers. Uniquely, we used performance of the patient PS (Rossion, 2018), a well-documented case of acquired prosopagnosia (AP), as a benchmark. Two main findings emerged: (i) PS could exhibit typical rates of accuracy in all tests; (ii) compared to age-matched controls and when considering both accuracy and speed to account for potential trade-offs, only the KFMT --- but not the EFCT, PICT or GFMT --- was able to detect PS's severe impairment. These findings reflect the importance of considering both accuracy and response times to measure individual differences in face matching, and the need for comparing tests in terms of their sensitivity, when used as a measure of human cognition and brain functioning.},

Such differences between and within individuals between and within laboratory tests raise practical challenges. This applies in particular to the development of screening tests for the selection of personnel in real-world settings where faces are routinely processed, such as at passport control. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the performance profiles of individuals within and across two different subprocesses of face cognition: face perception and face recognition. To this end, 146 individuals completed four different tests of face matching---one novel tool for assessing proficiency in face perception, as well as three established measures---and two benchmark tests of face memory probing face recognition. In addition to correlational analyses, we further scrutinized individual performance profiles of the highest and lowest performing observers identified per test, as well as across all tests. Overall, a number of correlations emerged between tests. However, there was limited evidence at the individual level to suggest that high proficiency in one test generalized to other tests measuring the same subprocess, as well as those that measured a different subprocess. Beyond emphasizing the need to honour inter-individual differences through careful multivariate assessment in the laboratory, our findings have real-world implications: combinations of tests that most accurately map the task(s) and processes of interest are required for personnel selection.},

  abstract = {This study presents the Kent Face Matching Test (KFMT), which comprises 200 same-identity and 20 different-identity pairs of unfamiliar faces. Each face pair consists of a photograph from a student ID card and a high-quality portrait that was taken at least three months later. The test is designed to complement existing resources for face-matching research, by providing a more ecologically valid stimulus set that captures the natural variability that can arise in a person's appearance over time. Two experiments are presented to demonstrate that the KFMT provides a challenging measure of face matching but correlates with established tests. Experiment 1 compares a short version of this test with the optimized Glasgow Face Matching Test (GFMT). In Experiment 2, a longer version of the KFMT, with infrequent identity mismatches, is correlated with performance on the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and the Cambridge Face Perception Test (CFPT). The KFMT is freely available for use in face-matching research.},

  abstract = {Background Postoperative delirium may manifest in the immediate post-anaesthesia care period. Such episodes appear to be predictive of further episodes of inpatient delirium and associated adverse outcomes. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings of suppression patterns and low proprietary index values have been associated with postoperative delirium and poor outcomes. However, the efficacy of titrating anaesthesia to proprietary index targets for preventing delirium remains contentious. We aim to assess the efficacy of two strategies which we hypothesise could prevent post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) delirium by maximising the alpha oscillation observed in frontal EEG channels during the maintenance and emergence phases of anaesthesia. Methods This is a 2 {\texttimes} 2 factorial, double-blind, stratified, randomised control trial of 600 patients. Eligible patients are those aged 60 years or over who are undergoing non-cardiac, non-intracranial, volatile-based anaesthesia of expected duration of more than 2 h. Patients will be stratified by pre-operative cognitive status, surgery type and site. For the maintenance phase of anaesthesia, patients will be randomised (1:1) to an alpha power-maximisation anaesthesia titration strategy versus standard care avoiding suppression patterns in the EEG. For the emergence phase of anaesthesia, patients will be randomised (1:1) to early cessation of volatile anaesthesia and emergence from an intravenous infusion of propofol versus standard emergence from volatile anaesthesia only. The primary study outcomes are the power of the frontal alpha oscillation during the maintenance and emergence phases of anaesthesia. Our main clinical outcome of interest is PACU delirium. Discussion This is a largely exploratory study; the extent to which EEG signatures can be modified by titration of pharmacological agents is not known. The underlying concept is maximisation of anaesthetic efficacy by individualised drug titration to a clearly defined EEG feature. The interventions are already clinically used strategies in anaesthetic practice, but have not been formally evaluated. The addition of propofol during the emergence phase of volatile-based general anaesthesia is known to reduce emergence delirium in children; however, the efficacy of this strategy in older patients is not known.

  abstract = {Decisions about noisy stimuli are widely understood to be made by accumulating evidence up to a decision bound that can be adjusted according to task demands. However, relatively little is known about how such mechanisms operate in continuous monitoring contexts requiring intermittent target detection. Here, we examined neural decision processes underlying detection of 1 s coherence targets within continuous random dot motion, and how they are adjusted across contexts with weak, strong, or randomly mixed weak/strong targets. Our prediction was that decision bounds would be set lower when weak targets are more prevalent. Behavioural hit and false alarm rate patterns were consistent with this, and were well captured by a bound-adjustable leaky accumulator model. However, beta-band EEG signatures of motor preparation contradicted this, instead indicating lower bounds in the strong-target context. We thus tested two alternative models in which decision-bound dynamics were constrained directly by beta measurements, respectively, featuring leaky accumulation with adjustable leak, and non-leaky accumulation of evidence referenced to an adjustable sensory-level criterion. We found that the latter model best explained both behaviour and neural dynamics, highlighting novel means of decision policy regulation and the value of neurally informed modelling.},

Stochastic accumulator models commonly explain this speed-accuracy tradeoff by strategic adjustment of response threshold. Several laboratories identify specific neurons in prefrontal and parietal cortex with this accumulation process, yet no neurophysiological correlates of speed-accuracy tradeoff have been described. We trained macaque monkeys to trade speed for accuracy on cue during visual search and recorded the activity of neurons in the frontal eye field. Unpredicted by any model, we discovered that speed-accuracy tradeoff is accomplished through several distinct adjustments. Visually responsive neurons modulated baseline firing rate, sensory gain, and the duration of perceptual processing. Movement neurons triggered responses with activity modulated in a direction opposite of model predictions. Thus, current stochastic accumulator models provide an incomplete description of the neural processes accomplishing speed-accuracy tradeoffs. The diversity of neural mechanisms was reconciled with the accumulator framework through an integrated accumulator model constrained by requirements of the motor system.},

  abstract = {Embodied cognitive attention detection is important for many real-world applications, such as monitoring attention in daily driving and studying. Exploring how the brain and behavior are influenced by visual sensory inputs becomes a major challenge in the real world. The neural activity of embodied mind cognitive states can be understood through simple symbol experimental design. However, searching for a particular target in the real world is more complicated than during a simple symbol experiment in the laboratory setting. Hence, the development of realistic situations for investigating the neural dynamics of subjects during real-world environments is critical. This study designed a novel military-inspired target detection task for investigating the neural activities of performing embodied cognition tasks in the real-world setting. We adopted independent component analysis (ICA) and electroencephalogram (EEG) dipole source localization methods to study the participant's event-related potentials (ERPs), event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), and power spectral density (PSD) during the target detection task using a wireless EEG system, which is more convenient for real-life use. Behavioral results showed that the response time in the congruent condition (582 ms) was shorter than those in the incongruent (666 ms) and nontarget (863 ms) conditions. Regarding the EEG observation, we observed N200-P300 wave activation in the middle occipital lobe and P300-N500 wave activation in the right frontal lobe and left motor cortex, which are associated with attention ERPs. Furthermore, delta (1--4 Hz) and theta (4--7 Hz) band powers in the right frontal lobe, as well as alpha (8--12 Hz) and beta (13--30 Hz) band powers in the left motor cortex were suppressed, whereas the theta (4--7 Hz) band powers in the middle occipital lobe were increased considerably in the attention task. Experimental results showed that the embodied body function influences human mental states and psychological performance under cognition attention tasks. These neural markers will be also feasible to implement in the real-time brain computer interface. Novel findings in this study can be helpful for humans to further understand the interaction between the brain and behavior in multiple target detection conditions in real life.},

Studies typically assume that a photograph adequately captures a person's appearance, and for that reason most studies use just one, or a small number of photos per person. Here we show that photographs are not consistent indicators of facial appearance because they are blind to within-person variability. Crucially, this within-person variability is often very large compared to the differences between people. To investigate variability in photos of the same face, we collected images from the internet to sample a realistic range for each individual. In Experiments 1 and 2, unfamiliar viewers perceived images of the same person as being different individuals, while familiar viewers perfectly identified the same photos. In Experiment 3, multiple photographs of any individual formed a continuum of good to bad likeness, which was highly sensitive to familiarity. Finally, in Experiment 4, we found that within-person variability exceeded between-person variability in attractiveness. These observations are critical to our understanding of face processing, because they suggest that a key component of face processing has been ignored. As well as its theoretical significance, this scale of variability has important practical implications. For example, our findings suggest that face photographs are unsuitable as proof of identity.},

An online survey was conducted of Australian drivers (n=1984) who were also cyclists (cyclist-drivers) and drivers who did not cycle (drivers). Cyclist-drivers were 1.5 times more likely than drivers to report safe driving behaviours related to sharing the roads with cyclists (95\% CI: 1.1--1.9, p{$<$}0.01). Cyclist-drivers had better knowledge of the road rules related to cycling infrastructure than drivers; however knowledge of road rules related to bike lanes was low for both groups. Drivers were more likely than cyclist-drivers to have negative attitudes (e.g. cyclists are unpredictable and repeatedly overtaking cyclists is frustrating). Findings from this study highlight the need for increased education and awareness in relation to safe driving behaviour, road rules and attitudes towards cyclists. Specific recommendations are made for approaches to improve safety for cyclists.},

Here we examine how externally and internally driven variations in the quality of sensory evidence affect the build-to-threshold dynamics of a supramodal ``decision variable'' signal and, hence, the timing and accuracy of decision reports in humans. Observers performed a continuous-monitoring version of the prototypical two-alternative dot-motion discrimination task, which is known to strongly benefit from sequential sampling and temporal accumulation of evidence. A centroparietal positive potential (CPP), which we previously established as a supramodal decision signal based on its invariance to motor or sensory parameters, exhibited two key identifying properties associated with the ``decision variable'' long described in sequential sampling models: (1) its buildup rate systematically scaled with sensory evidence strength across four levels of motion coherence, consistent with temporal integration; and (2) its amplitude reached a stereotyped level at the moment of perceptual report executions, consistent with a boundary-crossing stopping criterion. The buildup rate of the CPP also strongly predicted reaction time within coherence levels (i.e., independent of physical evidence strength), and this endogenous variation was linked with attentional fluctuations indexed by the level of parieto-occipital {$\alpha$}-band activity preceding target onset. In tandem with the CPP, build-to-threshold dynamics were also observed in an effector-selective motor preparation signal; however, the buildup of this motor-specific process significantly lagged that of the supramodal process.},

The model indicates that all of these components were adapted in distinct ways and, in several instances, fundamentally differ from the conclusions of conventional diffusion modelling. The neurally informed model outcomes were corroborated by independent neural decision signal observations that were not used in the model's construction. These findings highlight the breadth of decision-process parameters that are amenable to strategic adjustment and the value in leveraging neurophysiological measurements to quantify these adjustments.},

Here we employ mobile EEG to characterise the allocation of attention across multiple sensory-cognitive processing demands during naturalistic movement. We used a neural marker of attention, the Event-Related Potential (ERP) P300 effect, to show that attention to targets is reduced when human participants walk compared to when they stand still. In a second experiment, we show that this reduction in attention is not caused by the act of walking per se. A third experiment identified the independent processing demands driving reduced attention to target stimuli during motion. ERP data reveals that the reduction in attention seen during walking reflects the linear and additive sum of the processing demands produced by visual and inertial stimulation. The mobile cognition approach used here shows how limited resources are precisely re-allocated according to the sensory processing demands that occur during real-world behaviour.},

  abstract = {Background aims Cell therapies are costlier to manufacture than small molecules and protein therapeutics because they require multiple manipulations and are often produced in an autologous manner. Strategies to lower the cost of goods to produce a cell therapy could make a significant impact on its total cost. Methods Borrowing from the field of bioprocess development, the authors took a design of experiments (DoE)-based approach to understanding the manufacture of a cell therapy product in pre-clinical development, analyzing main cost factors in the production process. The cells used for these studies were autologous CD4+ T lymphocytes gene-edited using CRISPR/Cas9 and recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) to restore normal FOXP3 gene expression as a prospective investigational product for patients with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. Results Using gene editing efficiency as the response variable, an initial screen was conducted for other variables that could influence the editing frequency. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) of AAV and amount of single guide RNA (sgRNA) were the significant factors used for the optimization step to generate a response contour plot. Cost analysis was done for multiple points in the design space to find cost drivers that could be reduced. For the range of values tested (50\hspace{0.166em}000--750\hspace{0.166em}000 vg/cell AAV and 0.8--4 {$\mu$}g sgRNA), editing with the highest MOI and sgRNA yielded the best gene editing frequency. However, cost analysis showed the optimal solution was gene editing at 193\hspace{0.166em}000 vg/cell AAV and 1.78 {$\mu$}g sgRNA. Conclusions The authors used DoE to define key factors affecting the gene editing process for a potential investigational therapeutic, providing a novel and faster data-based approach to understanding factors driving complex biological processes. This approach could be applied in process development and aid in achieving more robust strategies for the manufacture of cellular therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of studies using evidence-accumulation models (such as the drift diffusion model, DDM) in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. These models go beyond observed behavior to extract descriptions of latent cognitive processes that have been linked to different brain substrates. Accordingly, it is important for psychology and neuroscience researchers to be able to understand published findings based on these models. However, many articles using (and explaining) these models assume that the reader already has a fairly deep understanding of (and interest in) the computational and mathematical underpinnings, which may limit many readers' ability to understand the results and appreciate the implications. The goal of this article is therefore to provide a practical introduction to the DDM and its application to behavioral data -- without requiring a deep background in mathematics or computational modeling. The article discusses the basic ideas underpinning the DDM, and explains the way that DDM results are normally presented and evaluated. It also provides a step-by-step example of how the DDM is implemented and used on an example dataset, and discusses methods for model validation and for presenting (and evaluating) model results. Supplementary material provides R code for all examples, along with the sample dataset described in the text, to allow interested readers to replicate the examples themselves. The article is primarily targeted at psychologists, neuroscientists, and health professionals with a background in experimental cognitive psychology and/or cognitive neuroscience, who are interested in understanding how DDMs are used in the literature, as well as some who may to go on to apply these approaches in their own work.},

  abstract = {Research on emotions in road traffic has focused on car drivers rather than on cyclists. However, cyclists experience cycling anger and its consequences as vulnerable road users, i.e., without having a car-like protection zone around them. To address the issue of cycling anger, we suggest a psychological measure assessing cyclists' anger experiences in traffic, the Cycling Anger Scale (CAS). This questionnaire assesses cyclists' anger experiences in interaction with their cycling environment. A principal component analysis and a following confirmatory factor analyses with two different samples proposed a 14 items questionnaire solution with four subscales: police interaction, car interaction, cyclist interaction, and pedestrian interaction. Alpha reliabilities were acceptable to good. The CAS correlated significantly with the Driving Anger Scale (DAS) for car drivers and with the general State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) suggesting convergent validity. Additionally, we examined the relations between cycling anger, demographics, and self-reported cycling behavior. We conclude that the CAS provides a complementary efficient instrument for measuring cycling anger in road traffic.},

In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data---accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions---into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

In such tasks, subjects are asked to respond when they detect the onset of a stimulus; the dependent variable is RT. We present a cognitive model for one-choice RT tasks that uses a one-boundary diffusion process to represent the accumulation of stimulus information. When the accumulated evidence reaches a decision criterion, a response is initiated. This model is distinct in accounting for the RT distributions observed for one-choice RT tasks, which can have long tails that have not been accurately captured by earlier cognitive modeling approaches. We show that the model explains performance on a brightness-detection task (a ``simple RT task'') and on a psychomotor vigilance test. The latter is used extensively to examine the clinical and behavioral effects of sleep deprivation. For the brightness-detection task, the model explains the behavior of RT distributions as a function of brightness. For the psychomotor vigilance test, it accounts for lapses in performance under conditions of sleep deprivation and for changes in the shapes of RT distributions over the course of sleep deprivation. The model also successfully maps the rate of accumulation of stimulus information onto independently derived predictions of alertness. The model is a unified, mechanistic account of one-choice RT under conditions of sleep deprivation.},

Diffusion model parameters were obtained from the fits to data from two experiments and consistency of parameter values, individual differences, and practice effects were examined using different numbers of observations from each subject. Two issues were examined, first, what sizes of differences between groups can be obtained to distinguish between groups and second, what sizes of differences would be needed to find individual subjects that had a deficit relative to a control group. The parameter values from the experiments provided ranges that were used in a simulation study to examine recovery of individual differences. This study used several diffusion model fitting programs, fitting methods, and published packages. In a second simulation study, 64 sets of simulated data from each of 48 sets of parameter values (spanning the range of typical values obtained from fits to data) were fit with the different methods and biases and standard deviations in recovered model parameters were compared across methods. Finally, in a third simulation study, a comparison between a standard chi-square method and a hierarchical Bayesian method was performed. The results from these studies can be used as a starting point for selecting fitting methods and as a basis for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of using diffusion model analyses to examine individual differences in clinical, neuropsychological, and educational testing.},

Stimuli can vary on two dimensions, the difference in strength of the two stimuli and the magnitude of each stimulus. Differences between the two stimuli produce typical RT and accuracy effects (i.e., subjects respond more quickly and more accurately when there is a larger difference between the two). However, the overall magnitude of the pair of stimuli also affects RT and accuracy. In the more common two-choice task, a single stimulus is presented and the stimulus varies on only one dimension. In this two-stimulus task, if the standard diffusion decision model is fit to the data with only drift rate (evidence accumulation rate) differing among conditions, the model cannot fit the data. However, if either of one of two variability parameters is allowed to change with stimulus magnitude, the model can fit the data. This results in two models that are extremely constrained with about one tenth of the number of parameters than there are data points while at the same time the models account for accuracy and correct and error RT distributions. While both of these versions of the diffusion model can account for the observed data, the model that allows across-trial variability in drift to vary might be preferred for theoretical reasons. The diffusion model fits are compared to the leaky competing accumulator model which did not perform as well.},

Several commonly accepted signs of integration were also predicted by non-integration strategies. Furthermore, an integration model could fit data generated by non-integration models. We identified the features of non-integration models that allowed them to mimic integration and used these insights to design a motion discrimination task that disentangled the models. In human subjects performing the task, we falsified a non-integration strategy in each and confirmed prolonged integration in all but one subject.

  abstract = {Objective:  The objective was to establish a systematic framework for measuring and understanding cognitive distraction in the automobile. Background: Driver distraction from secondary in-vehicle activities is increasingly recognized as a significant source of injuries and fatalities on the roadway. Method: Across three studies, participants completed eight in-vehicle tasks commonly performed by the driver of an automobile. Primary, secondary, subjective, and physiological measures were collected and integrated into a cognitive distraction scale. Results: In-vehicle activities, such as listening to the radio or an audio book, were associated with a low level of cognitive workload; the conversation activities of talking to a passenger in the vehicle or conversing with a friend on a handheld or hands-free cell phone were associated with a moderate level of cognitive workload; and using a speech-to-text interfaced e-mail system involved a high level of cognitive workload. Conclusion: The research established that there are significant impairments to driving that stem from the diversion of attention from the task of operating a motor vehicle and that the impairments to driving are directly related to the cognitive workload of these in-vehicle activities. Moreover, the adoption of voice-based systems in the vehicle may have unintended consequences that adversely affect traffic safety. Application: These findings can be used to help inform scientifically based policies on driver distraction, particularly as they relate to cognitive distraction stemming from the diversion of attention to other concurrent activities in the vehicle.},

These identifications affect the course and outcome of criminal investigations and convictions. Despite calls for research on sources of human error in forensic examination, existing scientific knowledge of face matching accuracy is based, almost exclusively, on people without formal training. Here, we administered three challenging face matching tests to a group of forensic examiners with many years' experience of comparing face images for law enforcement and government agencies. Examiners outperformed untrained participants and computer algorithms, thereby providing the first evidence that these examiners are experts at this task. Notably, computationally fusing responses of multiple experts produced near-perfect performance. Results also revealed qualitative differences between expert and non-expert performance. First, examiners' superiority was greatest at longer exposure durations, suggestive of more entailed comparison in forensic examiners. Second, experts were less impaired by image inversion than non-expert students, contrasting with face memory studies that show larger face inversion effects in high performers. We conclude that expertise in matching identity across unfamiliar face images is supported by processes that differ qualitatively from those supporting memory for individual faces.},

  abstract = {This study explored the beliefs and attitudes of cyclists and drivers regarding cyclist visibility, use of visibility aids and crashes involving cyclists and motorists. Data are presented for 1460 participants (622 drivers and 838 cyclists) and demonstrate that there are high rates of cyclist--vehicle crashes, many of which were reported to be due to the driver not seeing the cyclist in time to avoid a collision. A divergence in attitudes was also apparent in terms of attribution of responsibility in cyclist--vehicle conflicts on the road. While the use of visibility aids was advocated by cyclists, this was not reflected in self-reported wearing patterns, and cyclists reported that the distance at which they would be first recognised by a driver was twice that estimated by the drivers. Collectively, these results suggest that interventions should target cyclists' use of visibility aids, which is less than optimal in this population, as well as re-educating both groups regarding visibility issues.},
